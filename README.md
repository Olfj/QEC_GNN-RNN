## args.py

Contains the Args dataclass that is used to set various parameters for decoder training and inference.

## data.py

Contains the Data class that is used to generate simulated surface code data using Stim. 

## gru_decoder.py

Contains our decoder, and methods to train and evaluate it.

## mwpm.py

Contains a method that tests MWPM. Can be used as a benchmark when evaluating our decoder.

## utils.py

Contains some helper methods.

## models

Directory containing weights and biases for models trained on code distance 3, 5, and 7.

## examples

Directory containing some code examples showing how to load, train, and test our decoder.
